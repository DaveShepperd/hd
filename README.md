Hex dump tool.

I wrote this little tool over 30 years ago. Used mainly on Linux nearly daily ever since. Before uploading to github, I added a --head, --tail and --wide option to it so it would be more useful on Windows when built with MinGW. This because Windows (XP,7,10) doesn't have pipes, redirects nor head nor tail nor less (although it does have more, that's not quite as handy to use without pipes).
